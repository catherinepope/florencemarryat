Florence Marryat (1833-99) was a novelist, editor, playwright, spiritualist, singer and actress. She wrote 68 novels during her extraordinary career, adapting some of them for the stage. She also acted with the D’Oyly Carte company in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, and toured with George Grossmith in his revue Entre Nous.

Marryat is best remembered in some circles for her ardent belief in Spiritualism, an interest that was reflected in her writing. There is No Death, an account of her experience in the sèance room, has remained in print since its first publication in 1891.

Although she left behind a vast body of work, there are few accounts of Marryat’s life and no definitive record of her literary output. Fortunately, she has started attracting interest from researchers in the field of Victorian Studies and some of her novels are in print once more.

This website celebrates her achievements and hopes to introduce the remarkable Florence Marryat to a wider audience.
